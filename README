# Short Description:
A Lispy language implemented in Javascript.

# Longer Description:
* A JavaScript implementation of R. Kent Dybvig's Heap Based Scheme as described in Chapter 3 of "Three Implementation Models for Scheme". http://github.com/z5h/zb-lisp/raw/master/ThreeImplementationModelsForScheme.pdf
* Supports tail call optimization and continuations.
* Ability to implement Scheme functions with JavaScript functions.

Supported forms include:
define, quote, lambda, if, set!, call/cc, =,
cons, car, cdr, null?, pair?, 
+, -, *, /,
map, foldl, foldr, list,
display, newline,
not,
let, "named let", let*

Macro support is the next big step. Things will likely be quiet here while I work through that.
